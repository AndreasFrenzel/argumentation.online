## Welcome to argumentation.online!

**_argumentation.online_ collects, reviews and publishes argument reconstructions of high quality and various complexity.**

The reconstructions may be downloaded and used, e.g., for **educational purposes** by teachers in schools or universities, pupils, and students. Mostly they are reconstructions of arguments extracted from philosophical writings, but there is in general no restriction on the source the reconstructed arguments originate from. (For a short introduction to argument reconstruction click here. And click here for information on how to cite.)

Everybody is welcome to suggest her desired argument reconstruction or to submit her own. Indeed, we would like to encourage and invite you to do so! Your suggested reconstructions will be called for. And in case you submit a reconstruction, it will be reviewed by members of our editorial panel before being published. (For guidelines please click here.)

argumentation.online was created by us, a working group of the DFG-research network “Argumentieren in der Schule” (“Arguing in schools”). The idea to create this platform came to us through the collection of Micheal Bruce and Steven Barbone: Just the Arguments. 100 of the Most Important Arguments in Western Philosophy, Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. Considering Bruce&Barbone’s collection as a paradigm, our collection follows theirs in many regards, e.g., uniformly presenting reconstructed arguments in standard form, motivating each of them by an accurate and charitable interpretation, and so forth.

However, we value the fruits of formalization in the reconstruction of arguments and thus allow for the auxiliary use of formal logic. Moreover, for educational purposes we collect reconstructions of different levels of difficulty. By providing a plurality of good examples, we hope that this platform will contribute to teaching and learning the intricacies of argument reconstruction. It is our firm conviction that in order to improve one’s reconstruction skills one must discuss many good examples and, most importantly, try reconstructing on one’s own, again and again.
